  <div class="about-me">
    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <h2>My name is Paul Weimann,</h2>
    <p>
      and I am a frontend developer based in Berlin. I am passionate about creating beautiful and functional interfaces,
      and I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this personal website, I share my work, my experiences as a developer, and my ongoing journey of personal
      growth. You can also follow me on Twitter, where I often tweet about my interests, projects, and inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I enjoy a variety of activities such as reading, learning, watching UFC, and trying new
      recipes. I am also an avid sports enthusiast, and I particularly enjoy boxing, squash, running, snowboarding,
      wakeboarding, and surfing. These activities keep me active, focused, and balanced.

      forward to hearing from you! :)
